    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   The function `evaluate_robustness` takes a trained model, an environment, and some parameters for evaluation (number of episodes, noise standard deviation, and perturbation probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Results Structure:\n",
    "   It initializes a dictionary `results` to store rewards for three different robustness scenarios: observation noise, environment perturbations, and different initial states.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Robustness to Observation Noise:\n",
    "   - It runs `num_episodes` episodes with added Gaussian noise to the observations.\n",
    "   - For each step, it adds noise to the observation before predicting an action.\n",
    "   - It accumulates the total reward for each episode and stores it in `noise_rewards`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Robustness to Environment Perturbations:\n",
    "   - It runs another set of episodes, this time applying random perturbations to the environment.\n",
    "   - With probability `perturbation_prob`, it adds uniform random noise to the observation.\n",
    "   - It accumulates the total reward for each episode and stores it in `perturbation_rewards`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Robustness to Different Initial States:\n",
    "   - It runs a final set of episodes, each time resetting the environment with random initial conditions.\n",
    "   - It uses a custom method `set_random_initial_conditions()` (which should be implemented in the environment) to vary the starting state.\n",
    "   - It accumulates the total reward for each episode and stores it in `initial_state_rewards`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Results Computation and Output:\n",
    "   - For each robustness scenario, it calculates and prints the mean and standard deviation of the rewards.\n",
    "   - Finally, it returns the `results` dictionary containing all the collected rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is designed to evaluate how well the trained model performs under different types of perturbations and variations, which is crucial for assessing the robustness and generalization capabilities of the reinforcement learning agent."
